Coursework 2 - Brushless Motor

=======================================================================================================================================

Operation of the motor is just as the specification details for the motor rotation and speed control.

When the mbed is plugged in it will align the rotor using motorHome and print out the rotor state.

Once this has been completed the mbed is ready to receive commands.

Input a number of rotations and/or a rotation speed as per the specification using a serial input and hit enter.

With a small nudge the motor will begin task entered and can be interrupted any time with a new task by typing it in as above.


The melody feature was not implemented.
